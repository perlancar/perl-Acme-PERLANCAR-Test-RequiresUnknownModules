# ABSTRACT: Distribution that has prerequisites to modules not on CPAN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution is created to test tools like L<App::lcpan>. It contains
prerequisites to modules that are not on CPAN. It should not be installable by
most CPAN clients (due to unresolvable dependencies) and should produce failure
reports from CPAN Testers.
